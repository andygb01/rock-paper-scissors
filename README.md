Rock Paper Scissors game from the Odin Project.

This has a simple HTML page and UI that plays first to win five rounds between player and computer. Game will display how many rounds won for player and computer, and won't change score if round ends in a tie.

Future update ideas:
- update webpage design
- add extra content or features for the game
